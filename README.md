# Heart Failure Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting mortality caused by Heart Failure using a dataset with 12 clinical features. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, and early detection and management using machine learning can be crucial in saving lives.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various clinical parameters that are considered significant in the prognosis of heart failure. These include factors like Anaemia, Diabetes, Blood Pressure, and Ejection Fraction, among others.

## About the data

| Column | Units | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Anaemia | Boolean | Indicates decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin. |
| Creatinine Phosphokinase | mcg/L | It is an enzyme present in the heart, whose elevated levels in the bloodstream indicate muscle or cardiac damage. |
| Diabetes | Boolean | It is a chronic medical condition characterized by elevated blood sugar levels resulting from insufficient insulin production or the body's inability to effectively use insulin. |
| Ejection Fraction | Percentage | It is a measure of the percentage of blood that the heart's left ventricle pumps out with each contraction, providing an assessment of the heart's pumping efficiency; a lower EF may indicate heart dysfunction or failure. |
| Blood Pressure | Boolean | Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood against the walls of arteries. |
| Platelets | kiloplatelets/mL | platelets help prevent excessive bleeding by forming blood clots at the site of vascular injury. |
| Serum Creatinine | mg/dL | Serum creatinine is a waste product generated by muscle metabolism that is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys. |
| Serum Sodium | mEq/L | Serum sodium refers to the concentration of sodium ions in the liquid component of blood. |
| sex | Binary (0 for women, 1 for men) | The sex of the patient. |
| Smoking | Boolean | If the patient smokes actively or ever did in past. |
| Time | Time in months | It is the time of the patient's follow-up visit for the disease in months. |


## Objective
Our goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting mortality risk with a high degree of accuracy, aiding in early intervention and treatment strategies.

## QUESTIONS

- What is the relationship between age and the risk of heart failure?

- In what ways does anaemia contribute to the overall risk of cardiovascular issues?

- How are levels of creatinine phosphokinase associated with heart health?

- To what extent does diabetes impact the risk and progression of heart failure?

- In what manner does ejection fraction correlate with verall heart function?

- How does high blood pressure contribute to the onset and development of heart failure?

- Is there a notable link between platelet levels and the risk of heart failure?

- What is the connection between elevated levels of serum creatinine and heart health?

- How does the level of serum sodium impact the prognosis of heart failure?

- Are there gender-based differences in the susceptibility to heart failure?

- What role does smoking play in the development of heart failure?

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization

## Installation
To set up the project environment, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/data-analyst05/MortalityPrediction_HeartFailure.git
```

## Usage
Run the jupyter notebook mortality_heart_rate.ipynb script to train the model and see the predictions:

```bash
mortality_heart_rate.ipynb
```

## Model Implementation
The model is implemented in Python, with preprocessing steps including data cleaning, normalization, and standardization. The model's performance is evaluated based on classification accuracy, aiming for at least a 75% accuracy or 0.80 R-squared value.

## Model Optimization
The model undergoes iterative improvements with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Each change's impact on performance is documented for transparency and replicability.
