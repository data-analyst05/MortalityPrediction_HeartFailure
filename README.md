# Heart Failure Prediction

## About the data

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Anaemia | Indicates decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin. |
| Creatinine Phosphokinase | It is an enzyme present in the heart, whose elevated levels in the bloodstream indicate muscle or cardiac damage. |
| Diabetes | It is a chronic medical condition characterized by elevated blood sugar levels resulting from insufficient insulin production or the body's inability to effectively use insulin. |
| Ejection Fraction | It is a measure of the percentage of blood that the heart's left ventricle pumps out with each contraction, providing an assessment of the heart's pumping efficiency; a lower EF may indicate heart dysfunction or failure. |
| Blood Pressure | Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood against the walls of arteries. |
| Platelets | platelets help prevent excessive bleeding by forming blood clots at the site of vascular injury. |
| Serum Creatinine | Serum creatinine is a waste product generated by muscle metabolism that is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys. |
|Serum Sodium | Serum sodium refers to the concentration of sodium ions in the liquid component of blood. |
| sex | The sex of the patient. |
| Smoking | If the patient smokes actively or ever did in past. |
| Time | It is the time of the patient's follow-up visit for the disease in months. |
